      A background in construction management taught me the value and importance
      of leadership. While in construction I found the project management style
      that focused on eliminating waste through lean principle to be the most
      effective. I've found that

        LEAN theory</a

      helps create effective code by finding an eliminating waste. An example of
      applying lean concepts would be minimizing code processing using dynamic
      programming to cache data. While not only can these practices be applied
      at the coding level it also can be used in overall project management
      while delivering a project.
